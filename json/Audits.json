As of August 31, 2012, the bank balances were $354,351 and $792,925 for the Public Works and Figueroa Plaza building maintenance accounts, respectively.\n\nThe purpose of our review was to evaluate internal controls over GSD's bank accounts and to determine whether GSD used the funds in accordance with their authorized purposes.\n\nThe bank accounts were used in accordance with their authorized purposes; specifically, for the Property Manager (CBRE) to process vendor payments related to the operations and maintenance of the two City-owned properties, subject to the review, approval and signature by GSD.\n\nWhile all check disbursements were supported, we noted minor observations related to GSD's documentary review requirements. However, we question the necessity of GSD maintaining these bank accounts, as the processes for detailed payment review are duplicated between CBRE and GSD. The agreement with CBRE requires they maintain separate and sufficient accounting records to support all disbursements; this function is supported through their monthly management fee. In addition, CBRE is required to manage expenditures within an established budget that has been approved by GSD, and expenditures over a certain dollar limit require GSD's prior written approval.\n\nTo streamline City operations while ensuring appropriate oversight and control of the property management function for these buildings, we recommend that GSD execute a new contract(s) for property management services that simplifies payment processing and eliminates the need for these City bank accounts that are outside the control of the Treasurer's Office. Under the terms of a new contract, CBRE could continue to receive a monthly management fee and be reimbursed for other direct expenditures, in accordance with an established budget.",

State and federal laws require the confiscation and forfeiture of all contraband— property that is illegal to possess per se. Other laws authorize the seizure and forfeiture of private property that is used in an extensive array of crimes. Therefore, LAPD may seize real and personal property that is used in a crime, and after a legal forfeiture process, may use the proceeds or the property itself to enhance law enforcement activities.\n\nCrimes for which LAPD dedicates staff resources towards pursuing asset forfeitures include only those that involve illegal drugs or money laundering, through the designated activities of personnel assigned to the Asset Forfeiture Investigative Detail of the Gangs and Narcotics Division. LAPD works independently or with other local, State, or federal authorities to file forfeiture cases—nearly all of which involve seizures of cash—with the Los Angeles County District Attorney or with the U.S. Attorney.\n\nDuring 2012 LAPD’s Asset Forfeiture Investigative Detail (AFID) reported the initiation of more than 500 forfeiture cases involving nearly $21 million in cash. Federal guides describe how LAPD may participate in federal asset forfeiture cases and qualify to receive as much as an 80% “equitable share” of the forfeited assets. Asset forfeitures resulting from violations of State law result in LAPD receiving a 65% share of forfeited assets. While AFID initiates asset forfeiture cases, accounting for the financial proceeds of asset forfeitures is the task of LAPD’s Fiscal Operations Division (FOD). Together, AFID and FOD comprise LAPD’s Asset Forfeiture Program (Program), whose activities were the focus of this audit. This performance audit was performed in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards and covered LAPD’s asset seizure and forfeiture activities during 2011 and 2012. Audit fieldwork was conducted between October 2012 and March 2013."

The investigation originated from two complaints reported to the Controller's Fraud Hotline, each alleging payroll breaches. One complaint reported the six-month long usage and approval of sick leave and family medical leave benefits for a sworn LAPD employee without having medical necessity. The complainant alleged that the employee was living out-of-state and seeking new employment during the six-month period. A second complaint reported that a non-sworn LAPD employee consistently works during the day while receiving a night-shift bonus payment.\n\nOur review found that a lack of LAPD. supervisory adherence to payroll policies and procedures led to two separate MOU breaches resulting in payroll overpayments to LAPD employees. A now former LAPD employee received $41,243 in sick leave and family medical leave benefits over a six-month period without providing information or documentation detailing an illness or medical necessity. During that period the individual also received holiday pay and continuation of City benefits. In addition, the now former LAPD employee was concurrently employed by an out-of-state police department while receiving City paid leave. Another LAPD employee has been receiving bonus payments for non-qualifying work. Had LAPD adequately followed payroll policies and procedures the MOU breaches and payroll overpayments could have been prevented."

The period covered by the management audit includes the fiscal years 2008 – 2012 (“the Review Period”).\n\nAs the plan sponsor of LACERS, the City has a strong interest in ensuring the effective administration of the System on behalf of its residents and taxpayers. This management audit is one of several mechanisms designed to allow the City to monitor LACERS. This Interim report focuses on certain priority questions identified by the Joint Administrators:\n1. Whether the administration of LACERS resulted in minimizing City contributions? (RFP Objectives 2, 4A, 4B, and 12E)\n2. Whether LACERS had adequately evaluated the ongoing costs and benefits associated with participation in actively managed funds as compared to passively managed funds? (RFP Objective 8)\n3.

We also evaluated the Department’s fleet management practices to identify opportunities to improvement. LAWA maintains a fleet of over 1,400 items including cars, trucks, motorcycles, and heavy equipment. This audit focused on light duty sedans, trucks, vans, and motorcycles that are maintained by LAWA, as categorized below: No. of Vehicles Home-Garaged Vehicles 84, Central Pool Vehicles 81, Vehicles Assigned to Divisions 651, Vehicles Assigned to Airport Police 213, Total 1,029.\n\nWe focused our review on LAWA’s passenger vehicles (e.g., light duty sedans, trucks and vans) that are being used to perform critical functions and support services in the areas of administration, airport operations, grounds and facility maintenance, engineering and construction, and security and law enforcement.\n\nThis performance audit included the current control structure and processes used to manage LAWA’s vehicle fleet, and sample transactions and activities from July 1, 2010 to October 31, 2012. Audit fieldwork was conducted between October 2012 and January 2013.\nSUMMARY OF AUDIT RESULTS Over the last two years LAWA has purchased light-duty vehicles totaling more than $2 million. Additional costs are incurred for maintenance and fuel for the vehicle fleet.\n\nOverall, our audit found that there is inadequate centralized accountability or control over the vehicles that are assigned to staff with authority for home-garaging and those allocated to LAWA Divisions and other pools. We noted that the inventory information produced by the fleet system was inaccurate, and LAWA has no utilization standard or process to evaluate the need for or best use of its existing vehicles. Divisional pool vehicles are routinely assigned to individuals, limiting their effective use by other staff, and some employees who use their personal vehicle due to a shortage of available pool cars have been paid excessive mileage reimbursements. In addition, there is inadequate control over the vehicle replacement process. LAWA should take immediate action to improve controls over its vehicle fleet, as well as maximize the usage of those assets and reduce overall costs."

The firm of Vasquez & Company LLP (Vasquez) was engaged by the Los Angeles City Controller’s Office to conduct a performance audit to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of LAWA’s financial operations, and identify opportunities for improvement. The audit focused on internal controls, processes, personnel and systems relevant to its core financial activities.\n\nLAWA is responsible for the physical elements of the airports it operates, which include runways, fueling facilities, passenger terminals and ground transportation facilities. From these capital assets LAWA generates revenues in the form of aircraft landing fees, lease fees, concession fees from tenants and parking fees. As a self-supporting department with no tax base, these revenues must be sufficient to fund LAWA’s operating, maintenance and capital expenses, debt service and required reserves. Annual revenues and capital grants for LAWA were approximately $1.1 billion in fiscal year 2012, while expenses were $809 million, resulting in an increase in net assets of approximately $279 million.\n\nThe primary objective of the audit was to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of LAWA’s financial operations, and identify opportunities for improvement. Our audit was performed in accordance with Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS) and covered conditions, activities and processes as of June 30, 2011, with consideration given to current conditions when considered relevant to the conclusions reached.\n\nOverall we found that LAWA’s policies and procedures pertaining to core financial activities are comparable to those found in a governmental enterprise environment, and are generally up-todate and communicated to appropriate personnel. The organization structure provides for key functions and reasonable reporting relationships. Personnel interviewed possessed qualifications commensurate with their roles and demonstrated an adequate understanding of their responsibilities. Information technology is in a transitional state as new system implementations are underway, planned or recently completed. The internal control systems with respect to fiscal processes, budgeting and management were found to be designed appropriately to safeguard assets and promote adherence to BOAC and management approved policies and procedures."

The investigation originated from a complaint reported to the Controller's Office expressing concerns that CCTV trucks had been unused for several years. The complaint also included information regarding the rental of SUVs for WCSD staff in lieu of utilizing existing BOS aSSigned fleet vehicles, which was also characterized as a waste of City resources. This report provides my conclusions from investigating those complaints. The WCSD operates and maintains the City's wastewater collection system which consists of over 6,500 miles of sewers. CCTV inspections are primarily conducted to assess the condition of sewer pipes subsequent to cleaning to detect potential blockages. A 2004 legal settlement mandated BOS to conduct 600 miles of sewer inspections on an annual basis. BOS has had continuous personal services contracts for CCTV inspections of City sewer pipelines since at least 2002.\n\nOne objective of this investigation was to evaluate 80S CCTV pilot program equipment purchases, utilization and program staffing. A second objective was to review and evaluate 80S' plan to lease SUVs with maintenance contracts under a forthcoming pilot program rather than purchasing new vehicles.\n\nThis review has brought to light the need for City managers to focus on the expected full cost impact prior to initiating any pilot program. Especially in times of fiscal constraint, but always as a good business practice, management should provide adequate support and analysis that demonstrates an expected economic benefit to the City for any proposed new endeavor."

Some Departments have also executed direct contracts with these providers for IT services.\n\nThis examination was initiated from a procurement risk assessment conducted by a third party that identified Commercial Programming Services, Inc.

While our analysis of CPS’ transactional detail found no issues of concern related to invoice payments, we noted that CPS has received a significantly larger proportion of total payments for IT services compared to the other pre-qualified vendors. The objective of this review was to determine if a fair and open selection process had occurred in the selections of CPS, or if there has been any inappropriate action or favoritism in awarding work to a specific vendor.\n\nBased on the total amounts paid to each IT vendor by City department, as well as total dollars spent on IT services and amounts paid to CPS, the Unit reviewed selection processes used by the Information Technology Agency (ITA), Department of Transportation (DOT), Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), Department of Building and Safety (DBS), City Planning (Planning), Housing Department (LAHD), and Community Development Department (CDD). Overall, we found that there is no consistent method used to select IT vendors to provide project-based services. While three Departments had sufficient evidence to support they had conducted an open and fair selection, the other departments either lacked documentation to support an open process, or indicated their understanding that a direct selection of CPS was appropriate. While the Unit did not find any specific indications of fraud, without sufficient assurance of a fair and open contractor selection process, there remains a risk of favoritism or inappropriate award."

Our review was limited to non-sworn employees because State laws preclude the City from changing how sworn personnel are paid the salary continuation benefits.\n\nThe audit covered salary continuation payments made between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2012. Fieldwork was conducted between January 2011 and March 2011, and between February 2013 and March 2013. In conducting our audit, we interviewed Personnel Department staff; reviewed applicable laws and City policies and procedures; and analyzed data residing within PaySR and LINX.\n\nWe found that the City pays a higher first year salary continuation benefit to non-sworn employees when compared to other California government agencies we surveyed. We also found that employees with the same exact salary could receive widely disparate IOD payments and that employees can easily receive more money (after income tax considerations) while on IOD, as opposed to working. We recognize that changing the current IOD policies would require negotiations with the City’s employee unions and changes to the Administrative Code. However, in light of the City’s budget situation, we believe that now is an opportune time to pursue actions, to make any necessary changes to future labor agreements, considering the significant increase in IOD payments made to employees. Total IOD payments were $12.6 million in 2009. By 2012, these payments had increased by 52% to $19.1 million. It should also be noted that the increase in IOD payments could be attributed to other factors, such as the work environment, that were not part of this review. We also found that City systems do not have adequate controls in place to minimize salary continuation overpayments to employees."

The objectives of the examination were to (i) assess the reasonableness of the proposed costs, (ii) determine the adequacy of the accounting system in accumulating costs under the proposed contract, (iii) evaluate the financial capability of HNTB and the 4 major subcontractors listed above.\n\nBased on our examination, we found that:\n\n• Costs proposed by HNTB were higher by $2,049,762 than the audit recommended costs. We recommend that the City of Los Angeles Bureau of Engineering (“BOE”) utilize the audited costs in its negotiations with HNTB.\n\nAs discussed in this report, our examination was limited to verification of proposed labor rates, overhead rates, mark-ups and unit costs used for other direct expense items. We did not verify the reasonableness of the proposed hours, mileages, number of copies or similar units of measurement utilized in the proposals. These were utilized in the examination merely to compare the total proposed, audited and recommended costs.\n\n• Documentation supporting the cost proposal was not adequate to determine whether the proposed overhead rates can be sustained by HNTB or its 4 major subcontractors for the 6- year period of contract performance. The City of Los Angeles risks overpaying on the contract if HNTB and its subcontractors’ actual overhead rates become lower during the period of contract performance. We recommend that the BOE consider utilizing a Cost-plus fixed-fee contract with a not-to-exceed amount for this project. In addition, we recommend that BOE consider capping the indirect expense rate to protect the City from unexpected increases in overhead rates.\n\n• Based on our evaluation, we found that HNTB and its 4 major subcontractors accounting and billing systems were adequate to identify, account for, record, and accumulate costs in proper costs pools.\n\n• Based on our analysis of key ratios, we found that HNTB and its 4 majors subcontractors are financially capable to perform on the proposed contract. Our evaluation of financial capability was based solely on the review of the most recent financial statements and not on financial projections. Therefore, certain events may occur during the performance of this 6-year project that might impact the key financial ratios of HNTB or its 4 major subcontractors. BACKGROUND\n\nThe Sixth Street Viaduct Replacement Project (“Project”) of the City of Los Angeles will replace the existing viaduct which was constructed in 1932. In April 2012, the City of Los Angeles BOE issued a Request for Qualifications to begin the process of selecting a design consultant for the Project. In October 2012, the BOE announced the selection of HNTB as the design consultant that will provide comprehensive design and support services through the final design, right-of-way and construction phases. The proposed contract is anticipated to be negotiated as a firm fixed-priced contract with estimated total costs of $27M and the expected period of performance is 6 years. The total estimated cost includes 14 subcontractors totaling $6.6M.\n\nThe objectives of the examination were to (i) assess the reasonableness of the proposed costs, (ii) determine the adequacy of the accounting system in accumulating costs under the proposed contract, (iii) evaluate the financial capability of HNTB and its 4 major subcontractors.\n"

State and federal laws require the confiscation and forfeiture of all contraband— property that is illegal to possess per se. Other laws authorize the seizure and forfeiture of private property that is used in an extensive array of crimes. Therefore, LAPD may seize real and personal property that is used in a crime, and after a legal forfeiture process, may use the proceeds or the property itself to enhance law enforcement activities.\n\nCrimes for which LAPD dedicates staff resources towards pursuing asset forfeitures include only those that involve illegal drugs or money laundering, through the designated activities of personnel assigned to the Asset Forfeiture Investigative Detail of the Gangs and Narcotics Division. LAPD works independently or with other local, State, or federal authorities to file forfeiture cases—nearly all of which involve seizures of cash—with the Los Angeles County District Attorney or with the U.S. Attorney.\n\nDuring 2012 LAPD’s Asset Forfeiture Investigative Detail (AFID) reported the initiation of more than 500 forfeiture cases involving nearly $21 million in cash. Federal guides describe how LAPD may participate in federal asset forfeiture cases and qualify to receive as much as an 80% “equitable share” of the forfeited assets. Asset forfeitures resulting from violations of State law result in LAPD receiving a 65% share of forfeited assets. While AFID initiates asset forfeiture cases, accounting for the financial proceeds of asset forfeitures is the task of LAPD’s Fiscal Operations Division (FOD). Together, AFID and FOD comprise LAPD’s Asset Forfeiture Program (Program), whose activities were the focus of this audit. This performance audit was performed in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards and covered LAPD’s asset seizure and forfeiture activities during 2011 and 2012.

We also evaluated the Department’s fleet management practices to identify opportunities to improvement. LAWA maintains a fleet of over 1,400 items including cars, trucks, motorcycles, and heavy equipment. This audit focused on light duty sedans, trucks, vans, and motorcycles that are maintained by LAWA, as categorized below: No. of Vehicles Home-Garaged Vehicles 84, Central Pool Vehicles 81, Vehicles Assigned to Divisions 651, Vehicles Assigned to Airport Police 213, Total 1,029.\n\nWe focused our review on LAWA’s passenger vehicles (e.g., light duty sedans, trucks and vans) that are being used to perform critical functions and support services in the areas of administration, airport operations, grounds and facility maintenance, engineering and construction, and security and law enforcement.\n\nThis performance audit included the current control structure and processes used to manage LAWA’s vehicle fleet, and sample transactions and activities from July 1, 2010 to October 31, 2012.

Additional costs are incurred for maintenance and fuel for the vehicle fleet.\n\nOverall, our audit found that there is inadequate centralized accountability or control over the vehicles that are assigned to staff with authority for home-garaging and those allocated to LAWA Divisions and other pools. We noted that the inventory information produced by the fleet system was inaccurate, and LAWA has no utilization standard or process to evaluate the need for or best use of its existing vehicles. Divisional pool vehicles are routinely assigned to individuals, limiting their effective use by other staff, and some employees who use their personal vehicle due to a shortage of available pool cars have been paid excessive mileage reimbursements.

The firm of Vasquez & Company LLP (Vasquez) was engaged by the Los Angeles City Controller’s Office to conduct a performance audit to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of LAWA’s financial operations, and identify opportunities for improvement. The audit focused on internal controls, processes, personnel and systems relevant to its core financial activities.\n\nLAWA is responsible for the physical elements of the airports it operates, which include runways, fueling facilities, passenger terminals and ground transportation facilities. From these capital assets LAWA generates revenues in the form of aircraft landing fees, lease fees, concession fees from tenants and parking fees. As a self-supporting department with no tax base, these revenues must be sufficient to fund LAWA’s operating, maintenance and capital expenses, debt service and required reserves. Annual revenues and capital grants for LAWA were approximately $1.1 billion in fiscal year 2012, while expenses were $809 million, resulting in an increase in net assets of approximately $279 million.\n\nThe primary objective of the audit was to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of LAWA’s financial operations, and identify opportunities for improvement.

The proposed contract is anticipated to be negotiated as a firm fixed-priced contract with estimated total costs of $27M and the expected period of performance is 6 years. The total estimated cost includes 14 subcontractors totaling $6.6M.\n\nThe objectives of the examination were to (i) assess the reasonableness of the proposed costs, (ii) determine the adequacy of the accounting system in accumulating costs under the proposed contract, (iii) evaluate the financial capability of HNTB and its 4 major subcontractors.", "General Government", "Contract Analysis", "Other Capital Projects or Maintenance", [ "http://controller.lacity.org/Audits_and_Reports/ssLINK/LACITYP_024554", null ], [ null, null ], [ null, null ], "13-21" ]

Specifically, we reviewed the Wells Fargo Bank depository account for bail refunds (Bail Refunds Account) and the Petty Cash Revolving Funds (PCF). The Bail Refunds Account had a bank statement balance of $68,968.75 as of August 31, 2012. DOT's authorized PCF was $5,025, consisting of $4,225 in the bank and $800 in cash. The purpose of our review was to evaluate internal controls over DOT's bank accounts and PCF cash and to determine whether DOT used the funds in accordance with their authorized purposes.\n\nOverall, we found that DOT used the Bail Refund Account in accordance with its authorized purpose, and the Petty Cash Fund for authorized expenditures. However, we noted that DOT inadequately tracked and monitored refund checks issued with corresponding replenishments. Also, based on our surprise count of the cash portion of the Petty Cash Fund, we noted a shortage of $300 in cash, most likely due to theft.\n\nDuring our review, we discovered a cash loss of $300 which was part of the authorized Petty Cash Funds, and we noted weaknesses in monitoring/replenishing the Bail Refund Account.
